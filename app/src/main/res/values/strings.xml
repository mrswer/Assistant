        Chatty Assistant needs your OpenAI key to work. In order to obtain it, visit
        \nhttps://platform.openai.com
        \nand create an account. Then create an API key at
        \nhttps://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.
        \n
        \nChatty Assistant will use your API key strictly to access OpenAI API
        when you enter a prompt. Your key will be stored as a standard Android
        application preference and as such may get backed up to your Google account
        so that it is available on your other devices.
        \n
        \nChatty Assistant is an open-source application, available at
        \nhttps://github.com/mtopolnik/Assistant
        \nwhere you can review and inspect its usage of your API key.
